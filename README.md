# Pre-Word Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is built for bootcamp students that may find it difficult to keep track of their
notes from class and homework modules. So, to remedy this, I've created this study guide 
where all relevant notes can be found in one easy to access, convenient location.

## Usage
